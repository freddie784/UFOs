# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a more aesthetic view of UFO sighting data using HTMl and Bootstrap. Also because there was a lot of data, filters were created to sort through specific instances of UFO sightings using a dynamic table and d3 to watch for events.

## Results
The way the website works is that when you first open it up you will be introduced to a page with an article about UFO sightings and wether they are Fact or Fancy. After the user has read the article they are then given a table that displays data of recorded UFO sightings. Next to the table there are filter options that allow a person to search the data by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.

An example of how it would work is a person who has heard many alien stories from California and wanted to see if there are more would type in the filter ca and that would return all the data we have on UFO sighting in California.

## Summary
A drawback to the current design is that the user has to put in an exact match to the filter or the table will not display results. One recommendation would be to use drop down bars for options that the user can filter through so they know their options instead of typing in a filter and hoping there is data on it. Another development would be adding a link to pictures or other websites that give more information about the sightings, so that the user can look more into it if they are interested.
